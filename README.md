# Yellow cab NYC 2020 dataset- Data analytics and predictions with Python

The dataset is called NYC taxi cab and is collected from: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

The data represents the taxi trips during 2020 in NYC. There are around 24 millions of rows. 

Each row represents a trip. Columns display relevant information to a trip such as the starting time, ending time, the fare amount, the pick up location , drop off location, etc

In this project, I applied the steps of data preprocessing (i.e: data quality assessment, data cleaning, data transformation) together with conducting exploratory data analysis and applyinng ML methods (SGDRegressor, SGDClassifire) to predict some target variables of interest (trip distance, fare amount, payment type)
